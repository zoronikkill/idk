   - Run the command: `pip install .`

Setting Up the ida library Python Module
----------------------------------------

* Run the Activation Script
   - You need to inform the `idapro` Python module of your IDA Pro installation. To do this, run the `py-activate-idalib.py` script located in your IDA Pro installation folder:
     ```
     python /path/to/IDA/installation/py-activate-idalib.py [-d /path/to/active/IDA/installation]
     ```
     If the `-d` option is omitted, the script will automatically select the IDA installation folder from which it was executed.

Using the ida library Python Module
-----------------------------------

* Import `idapro` in your script
   - Make sure to import the `idapro` package as the first import in your Python script
   - After importing, you can utilize the existing ida Python APIs

Example Script
--------------

   - To give you an idea of how to use the `idapro` module, you can check the `idalib/examples` folder in the IDA Pro installation directory

Note
----

   - Please make sure that the `idapro` module is always the first import in your script
