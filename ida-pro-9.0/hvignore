# This file protects against inadvertently adding undesired files to the vault.
# Note: it does not affect the files already present on the server.
# The syntax and processing of this file is very similar to .gitignore:
# https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore

# The user may add directory specific .hvignore files in his projects
# (please note the dot at the beginning of the file name).

# Backup files should not be added to the vault.
# Currently they are created by IDA after merging:
*.bak

# Temporary IDA files normally should not end up in the vault:
*.id[0-2]
*.nam

# This is not great because this also forbids standalone type libraries:
*.til
